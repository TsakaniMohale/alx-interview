An example of the first few rows:

Copy code 1 1 1 1 2 1 1 3 3 1

Each number in the triangle is the sum of the two numbers directly above it. For example, in the fourth row, the second number (3) is the sum of the two numbers above it in the third row (1 and 2). This pattern continues indefinitely.

Pascal's Triangle has many interesting properties and applications in mathematics, including:

Binomial Expansion: The coefficients of the expansion of (a + b)^n can be found in the nth row of Pascal's Triangle.

Combinations: The nth number in the mth row of Pascal's Triangle represents the number of ways to choose m items from a set of n items.

Fibonacci Sequence: The sums of the diagonals in Pascal's Triangle form the Fibonacci sequence.

Probability: Pascal's Triangle can be used to calculate probabilities in certain situations, especially those involving combinations and permutations.

Overall, Pascal's Triangle is a versatile tool in combinatorics and algebra, with applications ranging from probability theory to number theory and beyond.



Lists and List Comprehensions:

Understand how to create, access, modify, and iterate over lists.
Utilize list comprehensions for more concise and readable code, especially for generating rows of Pascal’s Triangle.
Functions:

Know how to define and call functions.
Pass parameters and return values, particularly how to return a list of lists representing Pascal’s Triangle.
Loops:

Use for and while loops to iterate through sequences.
Nested loops may be necessary for generating each row and calculating the values of Pascal’s Triangle.
Conditional Statements:

Apply if, elif, and else conditions to implement logic based on the position within Pascal’s Triangle (e.g., the edges of the triangle always being 1).
